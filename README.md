**Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis  **

Overview  
Air pollution is a major environmental issue affecting health and quality of life.
This project analyzes air quality data across various cities, providing insights into pollutant concentrations and AQI trends using data visualization and analytics.  

Tools Used  
- Power BI – Data visualization and analytics  
- Python – Data preprocessing and analysis  
- SQL – Data storage and querying  
- Excel – Initial data cleaning  

Abstract  
This project examines air quality trends by analyzing key pollutants such as CO, NO, SO2, and PM2.5. 
Using Power BI, an interactive dashboard presents AQI variations across regions, helping identify pollution hotspots and seasonal trends.  

Key Insights from Dashboard  
- AQI Overview: Total recorded AQI is 824.05K. Most polluted cities: Delhi, Jorapokhar, Amritsar. Least polluted cities: Ernakulam, Kochi, Coimbatore.  
- Pollutant Levels: CO 1.11K, NO 6.01, SO2 15.97, PM2.5 98.60. High PM2.5 levels in urban areas pose health risks.  
- Geographical Trends: South Asian cities experience varied AQI levels. Industrial and high-traffic zones show increased pollution.  
- Seasonal Impact: Winter worsens air quality due to temperature inversion. Monsoons improve AQI via natural cleansing.  
- Policy Focus: Regulations, emission control, and awareness campaigns are essential for improving air quality.  

Conclusion  
This project provides valuable insights into air pollution trends, helping policymakers implement effective environmental strategies.
Future developments could include machine learning models for AQI prediction, enhancing proactive measures for air quality management.
